# citygmlinfo

A very simple and lean program that simply takes as input a CityGML file and outputs some information about it.

I use it to get an insight into big datasets that are otherwise impossible (or almost) to obtain with any viewer or software.
It can easily parse and report on massive CityGML files (such as [Berlin](http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/downloadportal)), and it's rather fast.

I'll add other classes in the future.

```
$ ./citygmlinfo /data/Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf/citygml.gml
